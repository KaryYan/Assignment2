## üìÉ Project Description
This project aims to extract useful information from the parking infraction csv files available on the [City of Toronto portal](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/parking-tickets/). The focus on this project is "park on private property". Through this project, you will be able to analyze any parking ticket files on the portal and know more about the consequences of parking on private property. Positional parameter has been set up in the script to make it easier for you to run any csv file in your computer!

## üîç Usages
This project can be used to extract the following information from the parking ticket csv files:
- All types of parking infractions.
- Information about the fine: minimum, maximum and mean fine amounts across all parking infractions.
- Specifically for "park on private property", a new csv file would be generated to show what is the fine, and where the tickets were issued.

For example, through the following code, you would be able to see the mean of fine amount among all the parking infraction in the parking ticket csv file of your choice:

In your terminal, when the script and csv file are both in your working directory, you can run the script as following:
```
./Yongran_Assignment1.sh (you csv file)
```

You will see the mean of the fine amounts being printed as a result of calling the following function in the script:
```
function mean {
	cat $csv_file | awk -F',' '{sum+=$5} END {print "Mean of set fine amount is " sum/NR}'
} 
```
